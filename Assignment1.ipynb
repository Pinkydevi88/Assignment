    "# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? Eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",

    "#2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Variable is where data is declared to a reserved memory location. Its an empty box to fill with any type of data whereas string is a data to fill that empty box. \n",
    "Eg. a =\"ineuron\", a is a variable and “ineuron” is a data.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "Ans:   int    ; It is an integer type where data is assigned as a numeric value. Eg. a=10,b=20.\n",
    "       float  ; It is a decimal type where data is assigned as a decimal value. Eg. a=10.29,b=-45.89,.\n",
    "       string ; It is a collection of one or more character which is declared inside \"\" or ''. Eg. a =\"ineuron\",\n",
    "    b='education'\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Ans: An expression is made up of all combinations of values,operators, methods which is constructed to a syntax to get desired outcome in a single value. \n",
    "    Eg. This is an expression: >>> 3 + 2. Both values are integer values and the + is the mathematical operator.\n",
    "        This expression evaluates down to the single integer value 5.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "Ans: An assignment statement gives value to a variable and its just print it. In other side expression is a combine of \n",
    "    value, operator etc. \n",
    "    Here spam = 10 , there is no operator to work on like =,-,* etc so this is not an expression instead its a statement, \n",
    "    an assignment statement where the output will be \"10\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "#6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",

    "#7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",

    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "Ans: 'spam' + 'spamspam' -'spamspamspam'\n",
    "     'spam' * 3          -'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Ans: A variable name cannot start with a number. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and \n",
    "    underscores. \"eggs\" is alpha character whereas \"100\" is a number.\n",
    "    \n",

    "Ans: Integer- int()\n",

    "     string - str()\n",

    "#10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "Ans. TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "    Correct one: 'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'\n",
    "        output: 'I have eaten 99 burritos.'\n",
