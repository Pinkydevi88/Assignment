    "'''1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans: Functions are reusable and easy to call anytime. No need to write the same code again and again instead we can write \n",
    "once and call it infinite times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "Ans. When a function is called the program control jumps to that function definition and executes the statements inside the \n",
    "function body. After executing the body of the function, the program control jumps back to the part of the program which \n",
    "called the function, and resumes execution at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Ans. the def keyword is used for defining any function , specified a name followed by a colon \":\".\n",

    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "Ans. A function is a set of code to achieve a particular result and a function call is to call that function anytime to \n",
